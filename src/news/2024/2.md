Immunotherapy for tumors has been touted as the hope for overcoming cancer, and whether it's the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies that have been approved for numerous cancers so far, or the over-the-counter cellular immunotherapy represented by CAR-T, or the many cancer vaccines that are in full swing of development, they are just the tip of the immunological iceberg. Researchers are digging into the iceberg to find out more about how to control the immune response and how these therapies can be used in the clinic to reap the benefits, giving us more and more hope for survival, and perhaps the hope of conquering cancer. Expect more breakthroughs in immunotherapy and more miracles for cancer patients.

The 6th International Conference on Cancer Immunotherapy will be held June 1-3, 2024 in Shanghai, China. The conference covers topics including tumor microenvironment, cytokine therapy, immunotherapy for solid tumors, preclinical research and translational medicine. Welcome to the 6th International Conference on Cancer Immunotherapy.
