# seminar

This project, developed as a course assignment, simulates a seminar named International Congress of Cancer Immunotherapy and builds a portal website for it.

The project is built on [VuePress Theme Hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/), and its guide is enough to understand the project and build your own website if you want to do that.

The project is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://zhang-guodong.github.io/seminar/).

If the project was helpful to you, please **star** or **fork** it. Thanks!
